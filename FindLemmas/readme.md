This script inputs ShortWordList.csv , looks up each word on freedictionaryapi.com , and analyzes the definition for a possible lemma (root) of the word. It then outputs the original word, its definition, and a possible lemma (or the word again as the lemma, if none is found.) There is an adjustable limit of 900 lookups at a time, because freedictionaryapi.com limits the number of lookups to 1000 per hour. 

ShortWordList.csv, Lemmas2k.csv, DupesRemoved.csv, and Lemmas.csv are based on (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Matthias_Buchmeier/Spanish_frequency_list-1-5000) licensed under [CC-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ ) .

DupesRemoved.csv was generated by copying the lemma column from Lemmas.csv into a new document, and removing duplicates.
