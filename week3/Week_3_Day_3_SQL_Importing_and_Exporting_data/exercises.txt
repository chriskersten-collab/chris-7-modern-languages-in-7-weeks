Exercise 1 — Create Table
Write the SQL to create the applications table.
CREATE TABLE applications (
    company TEXT,
    applications_sent INTEGER,
    response BOOLEAN
);

Exercise 2 — Import CSV
Use \copy to import your CSV into PostgreSQL.
\copy applications(company, applications_sent, response)
FROM 'C:/path/to/applications.csv'
DELIMITER ','
CSV HEADER;

Exercise 3 — Verify Data
Write a SELECT query showing all rows.
SELECT * FROM applications;

Exercise 4 — Export Query
Export only companies with a response to responded.csv.
I suppose that "only companies with a response" means response = true
\copy (
    SELECT company, applications_sent
    FROM applications
    WHERE response = true
)
TO 'C:/path/to/responded.csv'
CSV HEADER;

Exercise 5 — Comparison (Written)

In 1–2 sentences, explain:
Why is SQL import/export preferred over loading CSVs directly in application code for large datasets?
It is easier and safer to edit a CSV file for import than to hard-code data for a table into application code. Another advantage would be that the CSV file can be more easily exported from another data source.

Go Further (Optional, Strong Signal)
Try one:

Add a PRIMARY KEY
(trying to add it to an existing table didn't work, making a new table did work.)
CREATE TABLE applications ( company_id INT PRIMARY KEY, company TEXT, applications_sent INTEGER, response BOOLEAN );

Use COPY vs \copy and explain the difference
COPY applications(company_id, company, applications_sent, response) FROM 'P:\Documents\PythonLessons\week3\Week_3_Day_3_SQL_Importing_and_Exporting_data\applications.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;
\copy applications(company_id, company, applications_sent, response) FROM 'P:\Documents\PythonLessons\week3\Week_3_Day_3_SQL_Importing_and_Exporting_data\applications.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;
Considering the instructions, \copy runs locally, while COPY runs on the server.


Export a filtered query using JOIN (if you want a challenge)
\copy ( SELECT applications.company, applications.response, contacts.contact FROM applications INNER JOIN contacts ON contacts.company = applications.company ) TO 'P:\Documents\PythonLessons\week3\Week_3_Day_3_SQL_Importing_and_Exporting_data\join_results.csv' CSV HEADER;
