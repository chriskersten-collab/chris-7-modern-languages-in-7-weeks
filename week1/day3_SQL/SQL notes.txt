Didn't work:
SELECT applications_sent 
	CASE
	  WHEN applications_sent = 0 THEN 'None'
	  WHEN applications_sent > 0 AND applications_sent < 10 THEN 'Some'
      ELSE 'A lot'
	END AS effort_level
FROM applications;

Works:
SELECT company FROM applications WHERE applications_sent > 5 AND response = false;
SELECT * FROM applications WHERE applications_sent > 5 AND response = false;
SELECT * FROM applications;

Didn't work:
SELECT * 
	CASE
		WHEN applications_sent = 0 THEN 'None'
	END AS effort_level
FROM applications;

works!
SELECT company, applications_sent, 
	CASE
		WHEN applications_sent = 0 THEN 'None'
		WHEN applications_sent < 10 THEN 'Some'
		ELSE 'A lot'
	END AS effort_level
FROM applications;

Works, example code:
SELECT company
FROM applications
WHERE
    CASE
        WHEN applications_sent >= 10 THEN 'A lot'
        ELSE 'Not a lot'
    END = 'A lot'
AND response = true;

Works, example code:
SELECT company
FROM applications
WHERE applications_sent >= 10
  AND response = true;

Written explanation:
CASE WHEN in SQL applies a logical statement to a field, an entire column in a table. Python's if statement applies logic to an individual value of a variable. SQL automatically iterates through the entire data set.
