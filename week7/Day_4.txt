🧪 Exercise 2 — What Should Be Async? (Critical Thinking)

For a Job Application Tracker, decide:

Should these be synchronous or async?

Answer sync or async, with one reason each.

Operation	                Sync or Async?	Why?
Save application to DB		Sync            To avoid duplicate records in the database.
Send confirmation email	    Async	        No need to make it sync, and also there usually isn't confirmation that an email was delivered.
Validate input		        Sync            Can't proceed until the input is validated.
Check authorization		    Sync            Can't do anything more until authorization is validated.
Send analytics event		Async           It can be independent of other events.
Generate weekly report		Async           It can be independent of other events.

🧪 Exercise 3 — Background Workers (Core Concept)

Answer briefly:

What is a background worker? A background worker is a separate, independent process or thread 
that performs long-running or intensive tasks (like sending emails, generating reports, or syncing data) 
in the background, preventing them from freezing or slowing down the main application's user interface (UI).

Why are background workers used? Background workers are crucial for improving application performance, 
scalability, and reliability by offloading time-consuming tasks (like sending emails, processing data, or generating reports) 
from the main user-facing process, ensuring the front end remains fast and responsive for users.

What kinds of failures are background workers especially good at handling? Background workers are particularly effective 
at handling failures that involve retries of transient errors, such as temporary network outages or 
database connection time-outs. They are also well-suited for managing partial failures in long-running jobs, 
enabling the operation to resume from a saved state rather than restarting from scratch.

🧪 Exercise 4 — The Outbox Pattern (Very Important)

Read carefully, then answer:

Scenario
- User submits application
- App is saved to DB
- Email must be sent
- System crashes right after DB commit

Questions

What went wrong? Probably something went wrong with sending an email. 

Why is retrying dangerous here? Duplicate records - Assuming the user was expecting a confirmation email, they might 
re-submit their application after waiting for an email.

What problem does the outbox pattern solve? Dual writes, unnecessary retries.

✍️ Short answers — correctness matters more than wording


🧪 Exercise 5 — Event-Driven Thinking

Answer briefly:

What is an event? Events are notifications that something happened (e.g., a mouse click) that trigger code. 

How is an event different from a function call? A function is called (possibly by an event) while an event is
a notifications that something happened.

Why are events useful for scaling systems? Events allow for delays and asynchronous behavior, while functions are synchronous.

🧠 Concept Check (Senior-Level)

Answer briefly:

Why should APIs return success before background work finishes? APIs should return success before background work finishes 
primarily to improve responsiveness, prevent network timeouts, and enhance scalability and user experience. 

Why should background jobs be idempotent? To prevent errors, data corruption, and duplicate actions.

Why is “exactly-once delivery” rare in distributed systems? Because it's extremely difficult to guarantee due to 
network failures, system crashes, and timing issues, leading to potential message loss (at-most-once) or 
duplication (at-least-once) before confirmation.
