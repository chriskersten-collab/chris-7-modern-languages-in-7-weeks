🧪 Exercise 1 — What Is an API? (Written)
Answer in your own words:

1. What is an API? An Application Programming Interface is a set of rules and protocols that enables
 different software applications to communicate with each other and exchange data. 
 It acts as a messenger or intermediary, allowing one application to request services or information 
 from another without needing to know the technical details of how the other system is built internally. 

2. Why do we use APIs instead of directly accessing databases? A database API, such as PostgreSQL or Oracle is 
thoroughly tested and understood. There is no need to re-invent a database interface, when there are many good choices
already available, saving time and resources. Using a well-established database can also help with reliability and security, 
again because it is thoroughly tested and well-understood.

3. Give one real-world analogy for an API. In a more general sense, I have seen an interface control document, which can
describe an API, but can also describe other types of interfaces: electrical, RF, mechanical, anything. 
So, a major part of an API would be documentation that describes the API. Another part would be the public-facing software 
interfaces, which should be described by the documentation. 

✍️ Write 1–2 sentences per question.


🧪 Exercise 2 — Identify API Boundaries
You have a Job Application Tracker with:
- UI (CLI or Web)
- Backend logic
- Database

Answer in bullets:
- What data flows from UI → backend?
    - User input:
        - Company name(s)
        - Application status
            - Response
            - Times applied
        - Contact(s) at a Company
            - name
            - email address
            - title
            - other optional information
        - Database queries, possibly made user friendly with a website and/or GUI.
- What data flows from backend → UI?
    - Results from queries
        - Previously entered user input: Company names, application status, contact information
- What data should never flow directly to the UI?
    - UI for non-technical users:
        - Hidden key(s) in the database
        - Errors that are difficult to understand. If an error is expected, such as invalid user input, 
            it should be explained so that a non-technical user can understand what went wrong and how to
            correctly format input. Another example of an expected error is the database being unavailable. 
            The user should be informed that the service is temporarily unavailable, try again later.
            Unexpected errors can be passed to the user, if the language has thorough error coverage, like rust.
            Other languagues, such as Python, do not have such protections, so an error that is difficult to understand or
            meaningless to a non-technical user should be logged and reported to a bug tracker.
    - UI for technical users - developers, admins - never say never! All information should be available. That's assuming that
        error logs and bug reports are part of the UI.

👉 Do not write code.


🧪 Exercise 3 — API Contract Thinking (Critical Skill)
Imagine this API endpoint:
POST /applications
    Not quite sure what that means, so I will start with a description that I looked up: 
    "A POST /applications API example involves sending a request to create a new application resource on a server. 
    The request typically uses the HTTP POST method, specifies a JSON body containing the new application's data, 
    and includes relevant HTTP headers. "
    That reminds me of when I was using a REST API with a web interface for a database. I probably forgot what it was called.

Answer briefly:
1. What input data does it need?  Request for data, usually JSON. Also, usually authentication information.
2. What does a successful response look like? relevant JSON data.
3. What errors might it return? Authentication failed, permission denied, no records found.
4. Who is responsible for validation: UI or API? Not sure, both, I suppose.
There are no perfect answers — explain your reasoning. 

🧠 Concept Check (Write as Comments)
Answer in 1–2 sentences each:
Why are APIs considered contracts? An API often is the interface between two independent organizations, such as companies. 
    In that case, a contract between the two groups will include the API or a description of interfaces.
What breaks when an API changes unexpectedly? Everyone who was not informed of the change is at risk of something breaking.
Why is backward compatibility important? That's related to the previous question about what breaks when an API changes 
    unexpectedly. If the change is backward-compatible, it won't break anything. For example, keeping all existing code the
    same, but adding features. If existing features are deprecated without warning, then whoever uses those features
    loses compatibility.

⭐ Go Further (Strong Signal) Pick one:

Option A — ASCII Diagram, Draw: Client → API → Service → Database, Label responsibilities.

Option B — Versioning Thought
Explain (in words):
- What could go wrong if /applications changes its response shape? 
    Not quite sure what that means, so I looked it up: 
        The API response shape refers to the defined blueprint or structure of the data that an API (server) returns 
        to a client after processing a request.
    Similar to the previous questions about backward compatibility and unexpected change, a change in response shape might
    break compatibility, and also violate a contract.
- How versioning (e.g. /v1/applications) helps.
    I suppose that versioning with APIs is similar to versioning of software requirements, which I have some experience with.
    Versioning is helpful because different clients (or customers) might be using different versions:
    Previous releases
    Current release, but different versions - Free trial, paid version, special custom version for one customer.
    It is necessray to keep track of versions of the API and related documentation so different groups can be
    "on the same page".
