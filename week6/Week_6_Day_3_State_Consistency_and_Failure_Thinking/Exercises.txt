🧪 Exercise 1 — What Is “State”? (Written)

Answer in your own words:

What does “state” mean in a software system? 
It is the data that an application, object, or system remembers from one point in time to the next.

Give 2 examples of state in a Job Application Tracker.
1. The SQL database made as part of the lessons.
2. Files in the File IO examples.

What is stateless in such a system? 
Most of the examples and exercises, if stateless means that each request is an independent, isolated transaction. 
Also, the user interface is stateless.

✍️ Write 1–2 sentences per question.
👉 Do not write code.

🧪 Exercise 2 — Where State Lives

For a Job Application Tracker, identify where state might live:

In memory (RAM)
State can be stored in RAM, but so far with the application tracker, it is not. 
RAM usually stores the state being processed, and transferred between the disk and UI. 
A risk is that state is lost when the application is shut down.

On disk
For the job application tracer, state about positions applied to is stored on disk, 
usually part of example code, but also in files. A risk is that disk storage is slower than RAM.

In a database
For the job application tracer, state about positions applied to is also stored in a database.
Lie disk storage, database storage is slower than RAM.

In the client (UI)
No state is currently stored in the UI for the application tracker. 

For each, write 1 sentence describing:
What kind of state lives there
One risk of storing state there

🧪 Exercise 3 — Consistency vs Availability (CAP Thinking Lite)
Imagine this scenario:
A user submits a job application, then immediately refreshes and checks the list.

Answer briefly:

What could go wrong? The request could be rejected. Old data could still be presented to the user.

Which is worse here:
Showing stale data
Or rejecting the request?
Rejecting the request.

Why?
If the request is rejected, the user might wonder what has gone wrong, could it be their network connection?
If stale data is shown, that gives the user more information: The updates haven't been fully processed yet, or
something went wrong when receiving the new data.

👉 No need to mention CAP theorem by name — just reason it out.

🧪 Exercise 4 — Idempotency (Critical Concept)
Answer in your own words:
What does it mean for an operation to be idempotent?
Idempotency is a property where applying an operation multiple times yields the same result as applying it once, 
preventing unintended side effects like duplicates.

Why is idempotency important for APIs?
So that retries after failures don't corrupt data or double-charge customers. For example, in the previous question, the user
submitted an application, then immediately refreshed the list. If the system returns the old list, they might re-submit their
application. A dupliicate application should not be stored, so the new application would be rejected.

Is POST /applications usually idempotent? Why or why not? Yes, for the same reason: there should not be duplicate data, 
so making POST /applications idempotent would prevent duplicate requests from creating duplicate data.

✍️ 1–2 sentences per answer.


🧪 Exercise 5 — Failure Scenarios (Design Thinking)
For each failure, answer:
What should the system do?
What should the user see?

Failures:

API receives the same request twice
Reject the duplicate request. 
Most users don't need to know their request has been rejected, but the transaction should be logged.

Database write succeeds but response fails
Inform the user about the service being temporarily unavailable, try again later. Maybe set a timer, and automatically retry
a few times, such as 3 re-tries after 2 seconds delay for each failed attempt.

API crashes mid-request
I suppose there could be some kind of timeout on the client or UI, to tell the user that their request could not be completed.

There are no perfect answers — explain your tradeoffs.

🧠 Concept Check (Write as Comments)
Answer briefly:

Why is managing state harder in distributed systems? There is more latency, and network slow-downs can mean that the 
latency is different every time. It's also possible that packets could be lost, meaning there should be ckecksums and retries
somewhere in the communications system.

Why do retries cause bugs?
It's related to the questions about idempotency: a retry can cause data to be duplicated, when it should not be.

Why is “exactly once” processing so hard?
Usually, it's not necessary to check that data was correctly delivered along each step. Having such a system in place would make 
it easier to tell if a retry is necessary, but also increases overhead - resources related to checking the data is correctly
sent and processed.
