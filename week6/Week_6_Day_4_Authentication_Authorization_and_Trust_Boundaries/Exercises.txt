🧪 Exercise 1 — Authentication vs Authorization (Written)

Answer in your own words:

What is authentication? Checking that a user's credentials are valid.

What is authorization? Check to see whether a user has permission to perform a certain action. For 
example, admins may have permission to modify any data, and view logs; users can modify data associated with them, but cannot
see log files or modify someone else's data.

Give one example of each in a Job Application Tracker. 
Authentication - username and password for the PostgreSQL database. 
Authorization - there isn't a need for it now, with one user. For multiple users, as in the earlier question, 
admins may have permission to modify any data, and view logs; users can modify data associated with them, but cannot
see log files or modify someone else's data.

✍️ 1–2 sentences per question.
👉 Do not write code.

🧪 Exercise 2 — Trust Boundaries (Critical Concept)
Answer briefly:

What does it mean to say “the client cannot be trusted”?
Considering that the internet is a part of nearly every system, the client could be anyone or anything. 
So, precautions must be taken to restrict access for anonymous users, and to some extent, most authorized users.

Name 3 things a backend must never trust from the client.
Raw input from the client.
Authentication / authorization status - the client cannor be trusted to assert that it is authorized.
Business logic - never processed at the client, the client should only see outcomes.

Where should validation always happen?
Somewhere other than the client - API or at each server, for example the database.

✍️ Short bullet answers are fine.

🧪 Exercise 3 — API Security Thinking

Imagine this endpoint: DELETE /applications/{id}

Answer briefly:

Who should be allowed to call this? Admins, and possibly a user that created that record. It would be better to
have another API call for users to hide or deprecate a record they don't want to see.

What checks must happen before deletion? Authentication and authorization, to determine if the person requesting
deletion has permission.

What could go wrong if these checks are missing? An unauthorized user could delete something.

👉 No code — reason it out.

🧪 Exercise 4 — Authentication Models (Design Thinking)

For each model, write 1 sentence describing:
What it is
One risk or downside

Models:

Username + Password - Account name for a user, and a password to allow access - downside is that if a password is too long or 
complex, the user might write it down.

API Keys - It's a unique code that identifies and authenticates an application or user when they request access to an 
API, a downside is that they authenticate the application, not usually a user.

Session Cookies - Session cookies are temporary, transient files that websites use to track a user's activity during 
a single browsing session, holding information like login status or shopping cart contents, and are automatically deleted 
when the browser is closed, good for storing state, not meant for security - authentication or authorization.

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - A JSON object that can be included in a URL to authenticate and authorize a user - risks are 
that they can be easily decoded, or intercepted at the client side.

🧪 Exercise 5 — Failure & Abuse Scenarios

For each scenario, answer:
What should the system do?
What should the user see?

Scenarios:

A user tries to delete another user’s application
The system should not delete the data, and inform the user that they are not allowed to perform that action. 
This is assuming the user is a regular user account, admins might be allowed to delete another user's data.

A request is missing authentication entirely
It depends on the type of the request. For data that is specific to a user, the un-authenticated request should be ignored or
rejected with an error message. There is some data - a public website for example, that an un-authenticated user might
be allowed to access.

A token is valid but expired
I suppose it would depend on policy - block requests and tell the user to request a new token, or possibly just replace the
token without telling the user.

There are no perfect answers — explain tradeoffs.

🧠 Concept Check (Write as Comments)

Answer briefly:

Why should authorization checks live in backend logic, not the UI?
The client cannot be trusted to authenticate itself, the backend has enough security to authenticate users and grant access.

Why is “security by obscurity” dangerous?
Eventually, someone will find out, no matter how obscure you think it might be.

Why is logging security events important?
So that admins, particularly security specialists, can see what happened, to fix any security problems that might happen.
